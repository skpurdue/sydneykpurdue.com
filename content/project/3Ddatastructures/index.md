Final project for *Data and Algorithm in Art* class project. Class taught by Associate Professor Jason Salavon.

Randomization code written in R. 3D figure code written in OpenSCAD. Expanded at the University of Chicago Research Computing Center Visualization Hackathon on April 7, 2018.

These forms represent, as data types, a list or vector (or a random walk), a matrix, and a tree. Within limits, the values of the different measurements that would make up a (numerical) form of these data types were randomized, and then coded into OpenSCAD. The hope is to someday make them completely randomized and generated within OpenSCAD, such that they could be easily printed as unique pieces, and to expand the number and refinedness of the data type representations. I think the matrix could particularly use some work to show the interconnectness of the mathematical construct. I would love to see these used as teaching tools, created to help first-time computer science learners construct mental models of the data types they're working with, which can be difficult to grasp within the flat constraints of nested parentheses and brackets.
